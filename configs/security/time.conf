# Time-based Access Control Configuration for OIDC Authentication
# This file should be placed at /etc/security/time.conf
# 
# This configuration provides time-based access controls for users
# authenticated via OIDC to implement temporal security policies.

# Default time restrictions for all services
# Format: services;ttys;users;times
# services: service names or ALL
# ttys: terminal types or ALL
# users: usernames, groups, or ALL
# times: time specifications

# TIME FORMAT SPECIFICATION:
# Times are specified in 24-hour format (HHMM)
# Days can be:
# - Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su (individual days)
# - Mo-Fr (ranges)
# - Wk (weekdays)
# - Wd (weekend)
# - Al (all days)
# 
# Special operators:
# - ! (NOT operator)
# - & (AND operator)
# - | (OR operator)
# - () (grouping)

# EXAMPLES OF TIME SPECIFICATIONS:
# Al0000-2400        # All days, all hours
# Mo-Fr0800-1800     # Monday to Friday, 8 AM to 6 PM
# Sa-Su0000-2400     # Saturday and Sunday, all hours
# Mo-Fr0800-1200|Mo-Fr1300-1700  # Business hours with lunch break
# !Sa-Su             # NOT Saturday and Sunday
# Mo-Fr0800-1800&!Dec25  # Business hours except Christmas

# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# 1. Time-based access helps limit exposure windows
# 2. Reduces risk of unauthorized access outside business hours
# 3. Supports compliance with access control policies
# 4. Provides defense in depth for security-critical systems
# 5. Helps detect and prevent insider threats

# MONITORING:
# Monitor time-based access violations:
# 1. Check /var/log/auth.log for time.so denials
# 2. Alert on access attempts outside allowed hours
# 3. Monitor for repeated time-based access failures
# 4. Track patterns of access attempts

# COMPLIANCE SUPPORT:
# Time-based access controls support:
# - PCI DSS (access controls)
# - HIPAA (minimum necessary access)
# - SOX (segregation of duties)
# - ISO 27001 (access control)
# - NIST Cybersecurity Framework

# EMERGENCY ACCESS:
# Emergency admin and root accounts have 24/7 access
# to ensure incident response capabilities are not
# restricted during emergencies.

# INTEGRATION WITH OIDC:
# Time-based restrictions work in conjunction with
# OIDC authentication and group membership.
# Users must satisfy both OIDC authentication AND
# time-based access requirements.

# TESTING:
# Test time-based access controls:
# 1. Test during allowed hours
# 2. Test during restricted hours
# 3. Test with different user groups
# 4. Test emergency access accounts
# 5. Test maintenance windows

# MAINTENANCE:
# Regular maintenance tasks:
# 1. Review and update time restrictions
# 2. Adjust for organizational changes
# 3. Update holiday restrictions
# 4. Monitor access patterns
# 5. Test restrictions periodically

# TIMEZONE CONSIDERATIONS:
# Time restrictions are based on system local time.
# Ensure all systems have correct timezone settings.
# Consider UTC for distributed systems.
# Document timezone assumptions clearly.

# BUSINESS CONTINUITY:
# Consider business continuity requirements:
# 1. After-hours support needs
# 2. Emergency response requirements
# 3. Cross-timezone operations
# 4. Maintenance window requirements
# 5. Holiday and weekend coverage

# PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
# Time-based access controls have minimal performance impact
# but consider:
# 1. Frequent time checks during high-volume operations
# 2. Complex time expressions may impact performance
# 3. Monitor authentication latency
# 4. Optimize time expressions for common cases
