```go
func TestTokenManager_ValidateToken(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        token   string
        want    bool
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid token",
            token:   "valid.jwt.token",
            want:    true,
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // ... more test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```
